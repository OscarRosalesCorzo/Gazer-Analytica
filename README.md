# Gazer-Analytica

I am passionate about understanding the world and finding ways we can shape it for the better, achieving
this by using Data Science to hold a fact-based perspective, from which we can describe reality and make
inferences that support our actions (Statistics).

Some tools I constantly use are:

- R (Data science tool, helpful to make calculations, charts, statistical models, etc)
- Power BI (Data Visualization Tool)
- Microsoft Excel (Formulas, Power Query, Power Pivot)
- Power Point (reports and slides) 
- SQL (tool to interact with databases)

Gazer Analytica is a personal project in which I will be using my data scientis skills to tackle topics related usually raleted to economics such as:

- Tenn pregnancy rates in latinamerica
- Venezuelan oil production
- European salaries
